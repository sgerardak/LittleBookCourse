    ### Hello, Investor Explorer!

    This interactive course is designed to help you achieve steady and rewarding returns in the stock market.  
    Why? Because **investing in the stock market is one of the best ways to grow your wealth over time.**  

    It’s not a “get rich quick” scheme but rather a “grow steadily and sustainably” approach.
    Throughout the course, we’ll draw from the wisdom of some of the most successful investors — 
    Joel Greenblatt, Warren Buffett, Wesley Gray, Tobias Carlisle, and others — and break down their ideas in a hands-on, easy-to-understand way. The goal is to give you a practical feel for how the market works and how to spot opportunities like the pros do.

    ### Imagine that you can get a **20% annual return** on your investments (which is entirely plausible).:

    Over the long term, your investment could multiply dramatically:

    - **6x in 10 years**  
    - **38x in 20 years**  
    - **1,469x in 40 years**  

    For example, if you invested $10,000 at the age of 10:  
    - By 30, your investment could grow to **$380,000**.  
    - By 50, it could grow to **$14,690,000**.  
    Pretty amazing, right? 🎯

    ### Why This Course?

    The great news is that investing doesn’t have to be complicated. Even **Warren Buffett** emphasizes that successful investing is simpler than most people think.  
    The real challenge? Cutting through the noise — the overwhelming flood of information, strategies, and advice.  

    Books like *The Intelligent Investor* offer incredible insights, but they can feel daunting or too theoretical. That’s where **The Little Book That Still Beats the Market** by Joel Greenblatt comes in. It simplifies investing into a clear, easy-to-follow formula.  

    Thanks to technology, we can now take these lessons to the next level!
